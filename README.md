## POC: Import Products with Laravel Excel

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates importing products into a Laravel 11 application using the Laravel Excel package. The project includes setting up a Laravel environment, configuring necessary packages, and handling large data imports efficiently. Key features include:

- Laravel 11 setup with Sail and MySQL
- Admin and user panels using Filament
- Product and Brand models with migrations
- Category management using Rinvex
- Excel file import functionality
- Queued import capability for large datasets

The goal is to test the import process with a large dataset (10,000 products) and address any memory overload issues.
